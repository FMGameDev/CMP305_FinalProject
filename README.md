## Project Description
Procedural methods final project. It is a Terrain Generator, creating montains and sea using different techniques and being abale to modify the terrain in real-time using the interface Imgui. This terrain work is done in GPU.

WARNING - Project may need re-targeted to compile. Check the version of the Windows SDK.
